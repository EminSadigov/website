       <ul id="hourofcode-listitems">
         <li><h3>Minutes before the event:</h3></li>
           <p>After leaving the university together, Team 07 headed to the location. They arrived there 40 minutes before the event time. Farah started to set everyone's computer up to use if any technical issue is faced during the event. Mirkamal was connecting the monitor to his laptop while Sarkhan and Emin were bringing chairs and changing the place of tables for more space. The letter of consent was given to the reception for parents to sign. In front of the door, Sarkhan was getting every participant's number. After that, Farah added all these numbers into one WhatsApp group. Emin was coordinating participants in the event room to ensure that everyone had seats. The age range of participants was from 10 to 15.</p> 
           <br>
           <li><h3>What happened during the Hour of Code?</h3></li>
           <p>The event started at roughly 16:45. Emin shared the Wi-Fi information with others, and Farah provided the link to the participants. Mirkamal started the event with the presentation provided by ADA University. After providing information and answering some questions about the university, Mirkamal guided everyone to click on the link and start coding by using the Classic Maze puzzle. As new blocks appeared, Mirkamal explained how they work, and other members helped participants with misunderstandings and hard parts. Some students had no device. Therefore, they used the laptops of Team 07 members. The event ended at 17:55.</p>
           <br>
         <li><h3>Did the participants use similar courses previously?</h3></li>
           <p>Some of the participants were familiar with this puzzle from their schools. However, as they continued, it became hard for them to complete some parts. That was the part where Team 07 members "shined". With the guidance of instructors, children could finish all tasks. </p>
           <br>
         <li><h3>Did they like it?</h3></li>
           <p>Definitely! As much as team members observed, participants really liked the event. After the event, some participants even asked if there would be any other events like that. Interestingly, the team was asked to schedule these events more often since everyone enjoyed it.</p>
           <br>
         <li><h3>How well did they progress through the course? </h3></li>
           <p>Participants were very talented. They finished all puzzles with well-organized guidance by members. Some children were seen to have several issues because of their devices. Nonetheless, these problems were solved by moving on to another device or using one of his or her friend's devices together. Collaborative learning and teaching were the main goals of the event. </p>
           <br>
         <li><h3>What went well, what did not? </h3></li>
           <p>Team members’ expectations were slightly different from the reality they came across. In the beginning, they all found it a little challenging to control the kids. Since all the kids knew each other there, they were initially talkative, which was not expected. Other than that, the genuine curious nature of the participants was comforting, since members had worried about the course potentially boring them.  Honestly, team members were a bit worried since it was their first experience, but as time passed, they were adapting better and better. The only problem during the event was the internet connection. Because of the high number of devices, there was a loss of signal during the event. However, the team opened their mobile hotspot for Internet assistance. </p>
           <br>
         <li><h3>What did you do for preparation? </h3></li>
           <p>There were several alternative places for the Hour of Code event, including Tela courses, school-lyceum number 83, and the 94th School. Unfortunately, the team could not cooperate with them because of the irrelevant schedule, required official letters, and lack of audience. Then, Mirkamal decided to negotiate with Arximed TTK. It is a training center in the 7th micro district, where Mirkamal lives. They agreed to work with Team 07. Miss Farida, the director of Arximed TTK, and Mirkamal announced the Hour of Code event by ADA students. Fortunately, during the event, the team had 21 participants. It was mentioned that every participant is recommended to have any smart device, such as a laptop, tablet, or mobile phone. To take and publish the recorded videos and pictures during the event, the team designed a special letter of consent that is provided below. All parents signed the letter. The biggest problem was the lack of a projector and smart board in the room. Thanks to Mirkamal, he brought a big monitor to duplicate the screen of his laptop. The room was small. So, everyone was able to see the screen.</p>
           <br>
         <li><h3>What were the main challenges?</h3></li>
           <p>The main challenge in this group’s work was finding a community with children. Thanks to Mirkamal and Arximed TTK, the group was able to find desired audience with required standards. Another challenge was scheduling the proper time. Team member struggled a little bit while trying to fit in the time schedule of the host community. At the end, the team figured every problem out. Their dedication helped them to accomplish their goal. </p>
           <br>
         <li><h3>Whom do you want to thank for support and how did they help your team?</h3></li>
           <p>Special thanks to Arximed TTK and Miss Farida for their help throughout the period. They helped to solve one of the biggest concerns of the team: announcing and inviting people to the event. Their consideration helped the team to gather interested individuals. Miss Farida's great effort and help is invaluable for Team 07. It was lovely to cooperate with them.</p>
